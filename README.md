MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol that is widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT) and other applications where low bandwidth and high latency are common.

The Paho MQTT library is a popular choice for implementing MQTT in Python.

Here's an example of using Mosquitto as the MQTT broker and Python with the Paho library to publish and subscribe to MQTT topics.

Step 1: Install Mosquitto

Step 2: Start Mosquitto Broker
`mosquitto`

Step 3: Install Paho MQTT library
`pip install paho-mqtt`

Step 4: Run the Subscriber
- to subscribe to the MQTT topic and receive messages.

`python mqtt_subscriber.py`

Step 4: Run the Publisher
- publish messages to an MQTT topic.

`python mqtt_publisher.py`
